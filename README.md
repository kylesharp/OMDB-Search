# OMDB-Search
This uses the OMDB API to perform simple searching based on movie title. It mostly acts as an high overview of my current abilities as an Android developer, as well as a good example of how to glue some of the libraries together.

It is built with MVP architecture, as well as uses Dagger for dependency injection. It uses Retrofit for network requests, RxJava for reactive data, and Glide for images. It includes both unit and UI tests, using JUnit4, Espresso, and Mockito where applicable.

Overall, it's a bit over-engineered for what it does, but the goal was to show my experience in a simple app, which I accomplished.
